# Car_Price_Prediction_ML
Car price prediction allows users to input various car details, such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant features through a user-friendly interface designed with HTML and CSS. The intuitive design ensures a smooth user experience.

Upon submitting the car details, the Python backend, powered by a trained machine learning model, processes the data to generate a price prediction.It uses a linear regression machine learning model. This model allows users to input car details on the webpage, and based on the linear regression algorithm, it generates an estimated car price, providing accurate predictions in real-time. The project showcases proficiency in web development, data processing, and machine learning with linear regression.
